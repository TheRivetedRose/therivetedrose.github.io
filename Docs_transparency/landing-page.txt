ABOUT SECTION
-------------
I approach security the way I approached operational roles: define scope, gather evidence, document findings, and iterate on defenses.

I maintain a dual-boot lab environment to ensure strong separation between daily-use systems and experimental testing. My focus is building repeatable detection workflows, structured technical documentation, and automation that reduces analyst workload.

CURRENTLY BUILDING
------------------
- Segmented dual-boot lab (Ubuntu host + VirtualBox VMs)
- SIEM experimentation and detection rule development
- Python-based log parsing and triage automation
- Structured blue-team playbooks

TOOLS & PLATFORMS
-----------------
Operating Systems:
- Ubuntu 22.04 (dual-boot lab host)
- Windows 10 (target VMs)
- Kali Linux (simulation VM)

Security Tools:
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- VirtualBox
- Elastic Stack (lab)
- Splunk (lab)
- Sigma detection concepts

Scripting:
- Python
- Bash
- PowerShell
