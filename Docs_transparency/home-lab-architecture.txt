PROJECT TITLE
-------------
Multi-VM Security Lab with Dual-Boot Host Isolation

SLUG
----
home-lab-architecture

SUMMARY
-------
A segmented cybersecurity lab architecture built around a dual-boot Ubuntu host to isolate virtual machine experimentation from the primary daily-use operating system.

TAGS
----
lab, virtualization, network, dual-boot, blue-team

FEATURED
--------
true

======================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This project documents the design and deployment of a security lab built using a dual-boot architecture. Ubuntu 22.04 is installed as a secondary operating system dedicated exclusively to virtualization and lab operations.

All experimental activity occurs within Ubuntu, providing stronger separation from the primary Windows environment. The lab supports attack simulation, packet capture, log collection, and detection experimentation in a controlled setting.

OBJECTIVES
----------
- Enforce OS-level separation for lab containment
- Design a segmented internal virtual network
- Simulate realistic attack and analysis workflows
- Validate connectivity, logging, and containment
- Document architecture and repeatable deployment steps

HOST ARCHITECTURE
-----------------
Primary OS:
Windows (daily-use environment)

Lab OS:
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (dual-boot partition)

Virtualization Platform:
VirtualBox (installed only on Ubuntu)

VIRTUAL MACHINES
----------------
- Kali Linux (attack simulation)
- Windows 10 VM (target system)
- Optional Ubuntu analysis VM (log collection / packet capture)

NETWORK DESIGN
--------------
- Internal VirtualBox Network for VM-to-VM traffic
- Static IP addressing for consistent correlation
- NAT enabled temporarily for updates only
- No port forwarding to host OS

Example addressing scheme:
10.10.10.10 - Ubuntu host
10.10.10.11 - Windows VM
10.10.10.12 - Kali VM

DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
------------------
1. Install Ubuntu 22.04 on separate partition (dual-boot).
2. Harden base installation and update packages.
3. Install VirtualBox and extension pack.
4. Create Windows and Kali VMs.
5. Configure internal networking adapters.
6. Assign static IP addresses.
7. Take baseline snapshots.
8. Validate connectivity using ping, SSH, and RDP (controlled testing).

VALIDATION & EVIDENCE
---------------------
- ICMP connectivity validation between nodes
- Wireshark packet capture of ARP, TCP handshakes, DNS queries
- Authentication log collection from Windows VM
- Snapshot restore verification

SECURITY CONTROLS
-----------------
- Lab runs exclusively under Ubuntu
- No host port forwarding
- NAT disabled during active testing
- Snapshot rollback capability
- Redaction of sensitive information in documentation

SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
-------------------
- Dual-boot architecture planning
- Virtualization management
- Network segmentation
- Static IP planning
- Packet analysis
- Log collection and parsing
- Structured technical documentation

LESSONS LEARNED
---------------
- OS separation increases operational discipline
- Snapshot management prevents configuration drift
- Time synchronization is critical for log analysis
- Static addressing simplifies detection development

NEXT STEPS
----------
- Integrate centralized logging (Elastic or Splunk)
- Simulate brute-force authentication attempts
- Develop initial detection rules
- Automate lab provisioning scripts
