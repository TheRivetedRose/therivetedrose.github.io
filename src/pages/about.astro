      <div class="prose-custom space-y-6">
        <p>
          I am a cybersecurity student working towards a role in Security
          Operations, with a focus on detection, investigation, and structured
          incident response. I am developing practical blue team skills through
          hands-on lab work, emphasizing log analysis, system hardening, and
          disciplined documentation. Prior to transitioning into computer
          science, I spent over a decade in operational security roles within
          the U.S. Air Force and later in law enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In those roles, I worked in environments where decisions had
          consequences and documentation had to be clear, accurate, and
          defensible. I conducted investigations, prepared detailed reports,
          maintained evidentiary standards, and operated in situations that
          demanded composure and critical thinking under pressure. That
          foundation translates directly to security operations: methodical
          analysis, attention to detail, and accountability in how findings are
          documented and communicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now applying that investigative rigor to my technical growth.
          Through coursework and independent lab development, I am strengthening
          my understanding of networking, logging, detection workflows, and
          defensive frameworks. My goal is to contribute in a SOC environment
          where structured analysis, technical skill, and clear reporting
          matter.
